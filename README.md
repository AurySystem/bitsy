# Bitsy
Bitsy is a little editor for games, worlds, or stories.
The goal is to make it easy to make games where you can walk around and talk to people and be somewhere!

# Make a game with Bitsy Color
You can use [the current Bitsy Color editor](aurysystem.itch.io/multicolorbisty) in your browser on itch.io! When you've finished your game, you can download it as an html file and share it. :)
You can clone or download this fork to mess with whatever we add to it if youw want.

# Bug reports
If you find a bug in this fork of Bitsy, please submit [an issue here](https://github.com/Rathermaddy/bitsy/issues).
If it's not in upstream don't bother the folks upstream oky? :3

# This fork
This fork turns sprites form 1 bit into indexed sprites, the plan is to make this a sorta expanded upon bitsy engine.
