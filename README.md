# Bitsy
Bitsy is a little editor for games, worlds, or stories.
The goal is to make it easy to make games where you can walk around and talk to people and be somewhere!

# Make a game with Bitsy
You can use [the official Bitsy editor](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) in your browser on itch.io! When you've finished your game, you can download it as an html file and share it. :)
You can eventually clone or download this fork to mess with whatever we add to it, right now it'd be kinda pointless

# Bug reports
If you find a bug in this fork of Bitsy, please submit [an issue here](https://github.com/Rathermaddy/bitsy/issues).
If it's not in upstream don't bother the folks upstream oky? :3

# This fork
Honestly we're just going to play with some weird ideas once we've read through the code to find what we want, possible intergrate some dialouge hacks.
Right now this readme is the only changed file :3
